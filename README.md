# SpringBoot_REST
Personal project to create and deploy a Spring Boot REST API.

As a father I have to deal with lunchboxes every day. 
The challenge is to make sure I have enough of the right
items for my lunchbox consumers, who happen to have particular
tastes and are upset when something is missing from
their lunchboxes. With this project I am modeling a lunchbox items
tracking system.
